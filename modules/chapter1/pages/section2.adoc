= Bonus Exercise: Git outta town!

== Acknowledgements

Most of this exercise was taken from our Red Hat DevOps Pipelines and Processes: CI/CD with Jenkins, Git, and Test-driven Development (DO400) course; credit to the Red Hat Training team that developed the course for those elements! Find more great material on using Git for all sorts of things in Chapter 2 of DO400! Stop by our Red Hat Learning Subscription booth to learn more!

== Goals
Explore setting up a GitHub account and interacting with a remote repository from the command line. You should be able to create tags, publish releases, and use forks to contribute to other repositories.

== Prerequisites
To execute this section, you will need a GitHub account. It can be either a personal or a work account. If you do not already have a GitHub account, navigate to https://github.com/signup and follow the steps on that interactive page!

Log in to your GitHub account and cache your credentials. Configure your git identity at the user level in your machine.

== Instructions


To set up the scenario necessary to complete this exercise, first you must create a new GitHub organization with your GitHub account.
Next, you will create a repository in the organization by forking the source code we provide at `https://github.com/RedHatTraining/DO400-apps-external`.
The repository forked in your organization will simulate a third-party project in which to contribute.

With the organization set up as a hypothetical third-party project, you will practice a common contribution workflow, forking the third-party project into your username account and creating pull requests back to the third-party project to propose code changes.


1. Create your own GitHub organization.
This organization will host your simulated third-party project.
.. Open a web browser and navigate to `https://github.com`.
.. Sign in with your GitHub credentials. If you do not have an account, then create one.
.. Click menu:+[New organization] in the upper right of the window.
.. Choose the Free plan. Click *Join for free*.
.. Configure your new organization.
Fill in the *Organization account name* field with the `_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org` value.
Type your email in the *Contact email* field.
Select `My personal account` as the owner.
Click *Next*.
+

--
.. In the confirmation screen, click *Complete setup*.
You must provide your password to complete this step.
2. Create a repository in your organization by forking the `DO400-apps-external` repository.
The newly created repository in your organization simulates a third-party project in which to contribute.
.. In a web browser, navigate to the repository located at `https://github.com/RedHatTraining/DO400-apps-external`.
.. Click `Fork` in the upper right and select the `_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org` organization as the namespace.
This creates the `_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org/DO400-apps-external` repository.
+
--
image::git-fork-org.png[align="center",width="70%"]

At this point, you have set up the scenario to contribute to a third-party project.
You will treat the repository you have just created as the _upstream_ repository, meaning that you will consider this repository as the third-party project you send your contributions to.
--
3. Fork the upstream repository to start contributing to the upstream project.
Fork the `_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org/DO400-apps-external` repository to your username account and clone the forked repository located at \https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/DO400-apps-external.
.. From the upstream repository main page located at \https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER-do400-org/DO400-apps-external, click `Fork` and select your username as the namespace.
+
--
image::git-fork-org-to-user.png[align="center",width="90%"]

The new fork is located at \https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/DO400-apps-external.
In this exercise, you will contribute to the upstream by sending pull requests from this fork to the organization upstream repository.
--
.. Click the *Code* button and copy the HTTPS URL.
.. Switch to the command line and navigate to your workspace folder.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$
----
--
.. Clone the repository by using the `git clone` command and the copied URL.
Enter your GitHub username and personal access token when prompted.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *git clone \
https://github.com/_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_/DO400-apps-external*

----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that you clone the repository from your username account and not from your organization.
====

By default, the `git clone` creates a folder with the same name as the repository and clones the code inside the created folder.
You can change the folder by adding the folder name as a parameter of the `git clone` command.
--
4. Create a tag. Next, create a release by using the created tag.
.. Navigate to the repository folder and create the `1.0.0` tag by using the `git tag` command:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *cd DO400-apps-external*
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git tag 1.0.0*
----
--
.. Use the `git tag` command to verify that the tag has been created:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git tag*
1.0.0
----

[NOTE]
====
If Git shows the output by using a pager, press kbd:[q] to quit the pager.
====
--
.. Use `git push origin --tags` to push the tag to your username fork on GitHub.
+
--
By default, Git does not push tags to the remote.
To push tags, you must use the `--tags` parameter.
If prompted, enter your GitHub username and personal access token.

[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git push origin --tags*
Username for 'https://github.com': _YOUR_GITHUB_USER_
Password for 'https://your_github_user@github.com': _YOUR_GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN_

 * [new tag]         1.0.0 -> 1.0.0
----
--
.. Switch back to the web browser and navigate to the main GitHub page for your fork located at \https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/DO400-apps-external.
Click the *Releases* link in the right pane.
+
--
image::git-releases-btn.png[align="center",width="50%"]
--
.. On the releases page, click btn:[Draft a new release].
+
--
[NOTE]
====
Normally you do not create releases in a forked repository.

You should use forks as a tool to contribute to the upstream repository.
Upstream owners can later create releases with your contributions.
====
--
.. Start typing `1.0.0` in the btn:[Tag version] field and select `1.0.0`.
This is the tag that you just created.
Do not change the `Target: main` selector.
.. Enter a value in the btn:[Release title] field.
The btn:[Existing tag] label should appear under the tag field, confirming that you are using the `1.0.0` tag that you created.
+
--
image::release-form.png[align="center",width="100%"]

Finally, click btn:[Publish release] to create the release.
This takes you to the newly created release page.
--
5. Create and merge a pull request from your username fork (origin) to your organization repository (upstream).
.. In your terminal, create a new branch named `hello-redhat`:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git checkout -b hello-redhat*
Switched to a new branch 'hello-redhat'
----
--
.. Inside the `hello` folder, create a new file `hellorh.py` with the following content:
+
--
----
print("Hello Red Hat!")
----
--
.. Stage and commit the `hello/hellorh.py` file:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git add hello*
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git commit -m "added hello Red Hat"*
[hello-redhat 60db2e8] added hello Red Hat
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello/hellorh.py
----
--
.. Push the new branch to the username fork by using `git push -u origin hello-redhat`.
The `-u` parameter is an alias of `--set-upstream` and it is used to set the upstream branch.
Enter your GitHub username and password if prompted.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git push -u origin hello-redhat*

--
image::release-compare-branches.png[align="center",width="100%"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you do not select `RedHatTraining/DO400-apps-external` as the base repository.
====
--
.. In the pull request creation form, click btn:[Create pull request] to submit the form and open the pull request.
+
--
[NOTE]
====
When creating a pull request, try to set meaningful titles and descriptions to add better context to your changes.
====
--
.. Review your changes and merge the pull request into the `main` branch of the upstream organization repository.
Click *Merge pull request*.
Click *Confirm merge* on the confirmation form that shows up.
+
--
[NOTE]
====
You should not normally merge your own pull requests.

In most cases, pull requests are merged by repository owners or maintainers.
Consider that, when merging this pull request, you have acted as the owner of the upstream repository.
====
--
.. A *Delete branch* button is displayed immediately after the merge.
The branch `hello-redhat` is unnecessary now because all of its changes have been merged into the `main` branch.
Click *Delete branch* to delete the `hello-redhat` remote branch.
6. Pull changes from your username fork.
Check that the `main` branch is not updated.
.. On the command line, switch to the `main` branch:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git checkout main*
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
----
--
.. Pull the changes from the `origin` remote.
The `origin` remote refers to the repository forked in your username account (`_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_/DO400-apps-external`).
Enter your GitHub username and password if prompted.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git pull origin main*
_...output omitted..._
From https://github.com/your_github_user/DO400-apps-external
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.
----
--
.. Run `git log` and notice that your changes from the `hello-redhat` branch were not incorporated.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git log*
commit c34ac6fcb5eea6ed4c62b665f0bb3b6c18f9a579 (HEAD -> main, `tag: 1.0.0`, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
_...output omitted..._
----

Note how the last commit in the `main` branch is still the commit tagged as `1.0.0`.
This is because you merged the pull request to the *upstream* repository (`_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org/DO400-apps-external`) and not the username fork (`_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_/DO400-apps-external`).
--
7. Configure and pull from the `upstream` remote.
.. In the web browser, navigate to the main page of your organization upstream repository, located at: \https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER-do400-org/DO400-apps-external.
Click the *Code* button and copy the HTTPS URL.
.. Configure a new remote called `upstream` to point to your organization repository:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git remote add upstream \
https://github.com/_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org/DO400-apps-external.git*
----
--
.. Pull from the `upstream` remote by using `git pull upstream main -p`.
Enter your GitHub username and password if prompted.
