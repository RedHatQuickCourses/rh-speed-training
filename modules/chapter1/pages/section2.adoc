= Bonus Exercise: Git outta town!

== Acknowledgements

Most of this exercise was taken from our Red Hat DevOps Pipelines and Processes: CI/CD with Jenkins, Git, and Test-driven Development (DO400) course; credit to the Red Hat Training team that developed the course for those elements! Find more great material on using Git for all sorts of things in Chapter 2 of DO400! Stop by our Red Hat Learning Subscription booth to learn more!

== Goals
Explore setting up a GitHub account and interacting with a remote repository from the command line. You should be able to create tags, publish releases, and use forks to contribute to other repositories.

== Prerequisites
To execute this section, you will need a GitHub account with SSH access enabled to the lab machine. It can be either a personal or a work account. If you do not already have a GitHub account, navigate to https://github.com/signup and follow the steps on that interactive page!

Log in to your GitHub account and cache your credentials. Configure your git identity at the user level in your machine.

--
[NOTE]
====
You can skip this step if you already have your git identity setup on your machine.
====
--
Open a new terminal window on your workstation, and use the `git config` command to set up your user name.

--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *git config --global user.name "_Your User Name_"*
----
--
Use the `git config` command to set up your user email.

--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *git config --global user.email _your@user.email_*
----
--
Use the `git config` command to review your identity settings.

--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *git config --list*
user.name=Your User Name
user.email=your@user.email
----
--

To connect to your GitHub account using SSH, we need to follow a few set up steps. Similar steps can be found on the GitHub Docs page titled "Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent"

First we need to generate a new SSH key on the lab machine. Navigate to the terminal window and enter the following command:
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@user.email"*
----
--
You will be prompted to enter a file location as well as a passphrase. In all of these steps, hit *Enter* on your keyboard without entering any information (i.e. leave it all blank).

Start the ssh-agent in the background:
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"*
>Agent pid 12345
----
--
The "pid" will vary depending on your machine.

Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent:
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519*
----
--
Next we need to add the SSH key we just created to your GitHub account. First, copy the SSH public key to your clipboard:
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub*
ssh-ed25519 HASH your@user.email
----
--
Copy the contents displayed by selecting them in the terminal, right clicking, and selecting "Copy"

Switch to a browser and go to https://github.com and make sure you are logged in. In the upper-right corner click your profile photo and then click the *Settings* option near the bottom of the menu.

In the *Access* section of the sidebar, select *SSH and GPG keys*

Click *New SSH key*

In the *Title* field, write "RH Speed Training Key" and leave the *Key Type* as "Authentication Key" 

In the *Key* text area, paste the contents of your clipboard using right click, and selecting "Paste"

Click *Add SSH key*


To test your connection, go back to your terminal window and enter the following:
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *ssh -T git@github.com*
Warning: Permanently added ...
Hi USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
----
--

If you receive an error "ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connectoin refused..." it means we have to edit a configuration file. The quick fix is to append the following to the .ssh/config file:
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
Host github.com
 Hostname ssh.github.com
 Port 443
----
--

Edit the file using the instructions below, or in the manner of your choosing:

--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *sudo vim ~/.ssh/config*
[sudo] password for student: *student*
----
--

Be sure to just add the new information at the end of the existing file, and then save your work.

At this point, you are good to head into the exercise! Note that even if you only made it this far before time ran out, learning how to set up a GitHub account and link it to your machine with SSH is an incredibly valuable lesson!

== Instructions


To set up the scenario necessary to complete this exercise, first you must create a new GitHub organization with your GitHub account.
Next, you will create a repository in the organization by forking the source code we provide at `https://github.com/RedHatTraining/DO400-apps-external`.
The repository forked in your organization will simulate a third-party project in which to contribute.

With the organization set up as a hypothetical third-party project, you will practice a common contribution workflow, forking the third-party project into your username account and creating pull requests back to the third-party project to propose code changes.


1. Create your own GitHub organization.
This organization will host your simulated third-party project.
.. Open a web browser and navigate to `https://github.com`.
.. Sign in with your GitHub credentials. If you do not have an account, then create one.
.. Click the Menu dropdown in the upper right of the window (Looks like a + with a downward arrow next to it) and click "New Organization".
.. Choose the Free plan. Click *Create a free orgainzation* in the column furthest to the left of the screen.
.. Configure your new organization.
Fill in the *Organization account name* field with the `_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org` value.
Type your email in the *Contact email* field.
Select `My personal account` as the owner.
If asked to Verify your account, do so by solving the puzzle presented.
Check the box to accept the Terms of Service.
Click *Next*.

--
.. In the confirmation screen, click *Complete setup*.
You may have to provide your password to complete this step.
2. Create a repository in your organization by forking the `DO400-apps-external` repository.
The newly created repository in your organization simulates a third-party project in which to contribute.
.. In a web browser, navigate to the repository located at `https://github.com/RedHatTraining/DO400-apps-external`.
.. Click `Fork` in the upper right and select the `_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org` organization as the namespace.
.. In the dropdown, select the Organization you created in Step 1 as the "Owner" and leave the repository name as is. Then click "Create fork."
This creates the `_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org/DO400-apps-external` repository.
.. At this point, you have set up the scenario to contribute to a third-party project.
You will treat the repository you have just created as the _upstream_ repository, meaning that you will consider this repository as the third-party project you send your contributions to.

3. Start contributing to the upstream project. The repository will now be located at \https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/DO400-apps-external (You will already be on the correct landing page if you are executing this immediately after Step 2).

.. Click the *Code* dropdown and toggle to the SSH option. Then copy the contents of the command (it will start with git@github.com)
.. Switch to the command line and navigate to your workspace folder.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$
----
--
.. Clone the repository by using the `git clone` command and the copied details.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *git clone git@github.com:USER/DO400-apps-external.git*
Cloning into 'DO400-apps-external'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 151, done.
remote: Total 151 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 151
Receiving objects: 100% (151/151), 149.14 KiB | 208.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (58/58), done.
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that you clone the repository from your username account and not from your organization.
====

By default, the `git clone` creates a folder with the same name as the repository and clones the code inside the created folder.
You can change the folder by adding the folder name as a parameter of the `git clone` command.
--
4. Create a tag. Next, create a release by using the created tag.
.. Navigate to the repository folder and create the `1.0.0` tag by using the `git tag` command:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation]$ *cd DO400-apps-external*
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git tag 1.0.0*
----
--
.. Use the `git tag` command to verify that the tag has been created:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git tag*
1.0.0
----

[NOTE]
====
If Git shows the output by using a pager, press *q* to quit the pager.
====
--
.. Use `git push origin --tags` to push the tag to your username fork on GitHub.
+
--
By default, Git does not push tags to the remote.
To push tags, you must use the `--tags` parameter.
If prompted, enter your GitHub username and personal access token.

[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git push origin --tags*
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/your_github_user/DO400-apps-external.git
 * [new tag]         1.0.0 -> 1.0.0
----
--
.. Switch back to the web browser and navigate to the main GitHub page for your fork located at \https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/DO400-apps-external.
Click the *Releases* link in the right pane.
+
--
image::git-releases-btn.png[align="center",width="50%"]
--
.. On the releases page, click *Create a new release*.
+
--
[NOTE]
====
Normally you do not create releases in a forked repository.

You should use forks as a tool to contribute to the upstream repository.
Upstream owners can later create releases with your contributions.
====
--
.. Start typing `1.0.0` in the *Tag version* field and select `1.0.0`.
This is the tag that you just created.
Do not change the `Target: main` selector.
.. Enter a value in the *Release title* field.
The *Existing tag* label should appear under the tag field, confirming that you are using the `1.0.0` tag that you created.
+
--
image::release-form.png[align="center",width="100%"]

Finally, click *Publish release* to create the release.
This takes you to the newly created release page.
--
5. Create and merge a pull request from your username fork (origin) to your organization repository (upstream).
.. In your terminal, create a new branch named `hello-redhat`:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git checkout -b hello-redhat*
Switched to a new branch 'hello-redhat'
----
--
.. Inside the `hello` folder, create a new file `hellorh.py` with the following content:
+
--
----
print("Hello Red Hat!")
----
--
.. Stage and commit the `hello/hellorh.py` file:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git add hello*
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git commit -m "added hello Red Hat"*
[hello-redhat 60db2e8] added hello Red Hat
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello/hellorh.py
----
--
.. Push the new branch to the username fork by using `git push -u origin hello-redhat`.
The `-u` parameter is an alias of `--set-upstream` and it is used to set the upstream branch.
Enter your GitHub username and password if prompted.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git push -u origin hello-redhat*

Branch 'hello-redhat' set up to track remote branch 'hello-redhat' from 'origin'.
----
--
.. Switch back to the web browser and navigate to the GitHub page of your fork located at \https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/DO400-apps-external.
Click *Pull requests* to navigate to the pull requests page.
In the pull requests page, click *New pull request*.
.. In the branches selection area, click the *compare: main* selector to select the `hello-redhat` branch.
Observe how you are merging your changes from the `hello-redhat` branch of your username fork (`_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_/DO400-apps-external`) into the `main` branch of the organization upstream repository (`_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org/DO400-apps-external`).
Next, click the *Create pull request* button to open the pull request creation form.
+
--
image::release-compare-branches.png[align="center",width="100%"]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you do not select `RedHatTraining/DO400-apps-external` as the base repository.
====
--
.. In the pull request creation form, click *Create pull request* to submit the form and open the pull request.
+
--
[NOTE]
====
When creating a pull request, try to set meaningful titles and descriptions to add better context to your changes.
====
--
.. Review your changes and merge the pull request into the `main` branch of the upstream organization repository.
Click *Merge pull request*.
Click *Confirm merge* on the confirmation form that shows up.
+
--
[NOTE]
====
You should not normally merge your own pull requests.

In most cases, pull requests are merged by repository owners or maintainers.
Consider that, when merging this pull request, you have acted as the owner of the upstream repository.
====
--
.. A *Delete branch* button is displayed immediately after the merge.
The branch `hello-redhat` is unnecessary now because all of its changes have been merged into the `main` branch.
Click *Delete branch* to delete the `hello-redhat` remote branch.
6. Pull changes from your username fork.
Check that the `main` branch is not updated.
.. On the command line, switch to the `main` branch:
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git checkout main*
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
----
--
.. Pull the changes from the `origin` remote.
The `origin` remote refers to the repository forked in your username account (`_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_/DO400-apps-external`).
Enter your GitHub username and password if prompted.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git pull origin main*
_...output omitted..._
From https://github.com/your_github_user/DO400-apps-external
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.
----
--
.. Run `git log` and notice that your changes from the `hello-redhat` branch were not incorporated.
+
--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *git log*
commit c34ac6fcb5eea6ed4c62b665f0bb3b6c18f9a579 (HEAD -> main, `tag: 1.0.0`, origin/main, origin/HEAD)
_...output omitted..._
----

Note how the last commit in the `main` branch is still the commit tagged as `1.0.0`.
This is because you merged the pull request to the *upstream* repository (`_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_-do400-org/DO400-apps-external`) and not the username fork (`_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_/DO400-apps-external`).
--
7. Clean up your local files and the remote repositories and organization.
Remove your local `DO400-apps-external` folder

--
[subs=+quotes]
----
[student@workstation DO400-apps-external]$ *cd ..*
[student@workstation]$ *rm -rf DO400-apps-external*
